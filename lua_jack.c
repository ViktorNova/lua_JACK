/*
 * This is some of the first C I've ever written, other than some cannibalized
 * stuff on Arduino. It's gonna be horrible, and probably won't even work for
 * awhile. Please do not read this if bad code makes you cry. Tackling such a
 * complex project as my first go is a decision I alone should have to live
 * with ;)
 * 
 * This is an incomplete implementation, but it works, and that's amazing to
 * me. I will expand this to be a general-purpose interface to JACK from Lua,
 * but I can grab my BBT info now.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - come up with a better name for the thing.
 * - maybe rename the repo
 * - add midi support
 * - add to this list, because there's a lot to do.
